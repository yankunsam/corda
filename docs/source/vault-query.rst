Vault Query
===========

Corda has been architected from the ground up to encourage usage of industry standard, proven query frameworks and libraries for accessing RDBMS backed transactional stores (including the Vault).

Corda provides a number of flexible query mechanisms for accessing the Vault:

- VaultService API
- custom JPA/JPQL queries
- custom 3rd party Data Access frameworks such as `Spring Data <http://projects.spring.io/spring-data>`_

The majority of query requirements can be satified by using the Vault API:

.. literalinclude:: ../../core/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/core/node/services/Services.kt
    :language: kotlin
    :start-after: DOCSTART VaultQueryAPI
    :end-before: DOCEND VaultQueryAPI

This API provides both static (snapshot) and dynamic (snapshot with streaming updates) methods for a defined set of filter criteria.
Simple pagination (page number and size) and ordering (ascending, descending) is also specifiable.

The ``QueryCriteria`` interface provides a flexible mechanism for specifying filtering, and simple pagination and ordering criteria. 
There are four implementations of this interface which can be chained together to define advanced filters.

	1. ``VaultQueryCriteria`` provides filterable criteria on attributes within the Vault states table: status (UNCONSUMED, CONSUMED), state reference(s), contract state type(s), notaries, soft locked states, timestamps (RECORDED, CONSUMED). Additiionally, you may specify simple pagination and ordering.

	   .. note:: Sensible defaults are defined for frequently used attributes (status = UNCONSUMED, ordering = Order.ASC).

	2. ``FungibleAssetQueryCriteria`` provides filterable criteria on attributes defined in the Corda Core ``FungibleAsset`` contract state interface, used to represent assets that are fungible, countable and issued by a specific party (eg. ``Cash.State`` and ``CommodityContract.State`` in the Corda finance module). 
	   
	   .. note:: Contract states that extend the *FungibleAsset* interface now automatically persist associated state attributes. 

	3. ``LinearStateQueryCriteria`` provides filterable criteria on attributes defined in the Corda Core ``LinearState`` and ``DealState`` contract state interfaces, used to represent entities that continuously supercede themselves, all of which share the same *linearId* (eg. trade entity states such as the ``IRSState`` defined in the SIMM valuation demo)
	   
	   .. note:: Contract states that extend the *LinearState* or *DealState* interfaces now automatically persist associated state attributes. 

	4. ``VaultCustomQueryCriteria`` provides the means to specify one or many arbitrary expressions on attributes defined by a custom contract state that implements its own schema. That is, any custom contract state that implements the ``QueryableState`` interface and defines an associated ``MappedSchema`` (using JPA or Requery annotations). See the Corda finance module ``CommercialPaper`` contract for example.
	
		.. note:: Custom contract states that implement the *Queryable* interface may now extend the *FungiblePersistentState*, *LinearPersistentState* or *DealPersistentState* classes when implementing their *MappedSchema*. Previously, all custom contracts extended the root *PersistentState* class and defined repeated mappings of `FungibleAsset` and `LinearState` attributes.

Examples of these ``QueryCriteria`` objects are presented below for Kotlin and Java.

The Vault Query API leverages the rich semantics of the underlying Requery_ persistence framework adopted by Corda.

.. note:: Permissioning at the database level enforces read-only access to underlying Corda tables.

.. note:: API's now provide ease of use calling semantics from both Java and Kotlin.

.. note:: Current queries by ``Party`` use a party name and associated ``CompositeKey``. In future it may be possible to query on specific elements of a composite key hierarchy (parent and child nodes, weightings). This decomposition of a ``CompositeKey`` may also be used to model identity hierarchies.

Other use case scenarios
------------------------

For advanced use cases that require sophisticated pagination, sorting, grouping, and aggregation functions, it is recommended that the CorDapp developer utilise one of the many proven frameworks that ship with this capability out of the box. Namely, implementations of JPQL (JPA Query Language) such as **Hibernate** for advanced SQL access, and **Spring Data** for advanced pagination and ordering constructs.

The Corda Tutorials provide examples satisfying these additional Use Cases:

     1. Template / Tutorial CorDapp service using Vault API Custom Query to access attributes of IOU State
     2. Template / Tutorial CorDapp service query extension executing Named Queries via JPQL (Hibernate_)
     3. `Advanced pagination <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/>`_ queries using Spring Data JPA_
