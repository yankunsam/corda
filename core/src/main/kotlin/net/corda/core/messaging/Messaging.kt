/**
 * A [MessagingService] sits at the boundary between a message routing / networking layer and the core platform code.
 *
 * A messaging system must provide the ability to send 1:many messages, potentially to an abstract "group", the
 * membership of which is defined elsewhere. Messages are atomic and the system guarantees that a sent message
 * _eventually_ will arrive in the exact form it was sent, however, messages can be arbitrarily re-ordered or delayed.
 *
 * Example implementations might be a custom P2P layer, Akka, Apache Kafka, etc. It is assumed that the message layer
 * is *reliable* and as such messages may be stored to disk once queued.
